[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeigen3_cmake_module.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "eigen3_cmake_module", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "eigen3_cmake_module" with any of the following names:

    eigen3_cmake_moduleConfig.cmake
    eigen3_cmake_module-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eigen3_cmake_module" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "eigen3_cmake_module_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "eigen3_cmake_module" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
